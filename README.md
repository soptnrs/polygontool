## Polygon Tool

This is the code for Assignment 1 to a graduate intro to computer graphics.  The user interface shell and basic drawing functions were
provided by the course, but the implementation of the inside out, circle overlap, stencil buffer, fill, and hole functionality were added 
by me.

# Where is the commit history?

This code is an import from my bitbucket account, where it was originally hosted as a private repo.  Now that I have private repos available
here, I will be using github more often!  If you want to see the commit history, go to my bitbucket account (same username).
